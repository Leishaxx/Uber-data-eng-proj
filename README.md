#Uber Data Engineering Project

Analyzed Uber's data to gather insights using tools such as Google Cloud storage, Mage AI, BigQuery and LookerStudio. 


## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)
Enumerate the main results of this project in a list and describe them.

*EXAMPLE:*
1. *Recorded over 1,000 unique prompts and their responses generated by ChatGPT*
2. *Identified three biases in ChatGPT's responses*
   - *When prompted about this world event*
   - *When prompted about this field of science*
   - *When prompted about this political party*


## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

*To accomplish this, I started with finding my dataset. I then made  adata model and wrote transformation code to supplement the model on Jupyter Notebook. I then utilized google cloud to store my data, create a VM instance so I could access Mage. I sed the load, transform and extract method to transport my cleaned dataset to BigQuery. I then used LookeerStudio to create visualizations to gather more insights about the dataset and people's habits while using Uber.*
