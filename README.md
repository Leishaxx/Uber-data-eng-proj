*To accomplish this, I started with finding my dataset. I then made  adata model and wrote transformation code to supplement the model on Jupyter Notebook. I then utilized google cloud to store my data, create a VM instance so I could access Mage. I sed the load, transform and extract method to transport my cleaned dataset to BigQuery. I then used LookeerStudio to create visualizations to gather more insights about the dataset and people's habits while using Uber.*
